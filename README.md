# VeKctor Engine 

A Search Engine for **ArXiv** Research papers, using both **Spare Retrieval**, advance **Dense embeddings** and **Hybrid retreival pipeline**, Focused on ML and DS side 

## 📌 Project Goals 

- Build a **Modular, well documentd search engine pipeline** for ArXiv papers.
- Implement **spare retrieval** from scratch including (Boolean search, TF-IDF, BM25).
- Implement **dense retreival** using **senstence embedding** 
- Try a Hybrid approach 
- Evaluation of the search quality with the IR metrics
- Deploy via **Flask API** for demo
- Document design decisions ,experiments and Journey studying IR 
- Make a youtube video going over the project and thought process and challenges
